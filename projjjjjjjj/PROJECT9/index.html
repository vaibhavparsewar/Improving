              JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that
              conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is used to create
              interactive effects within web browsers, server-side development,

              React offers several benefits including a virtual DOM for better
              performance, reusable components, unidirectional data flow, and a
              strong community. It makes building complex user interfaces more
              manageable and maintainable.

              CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create
              two-dimensional grid-based layouts. It provides a more efficient
              way to arrange elements in rows and columns, making complex
              layouts easier to achieve.

              additional functionality like DOM manipulation, geolocation,
              canvas drawing, and more. They allow JavaScript to interact with
              the browser and enhance web applications.
